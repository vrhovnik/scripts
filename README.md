# Scripts I use daily on my Windows machine with PowerShell

Scripts I use daily, some authored, some borrowed from respective authors by their permission or by them sharing scripts publically.

Scripts are built in different folders, and are called from the root folder:

1. *Codez* - scripts to be used for coding assistance
2. *Random* - random scripts to get weather info, to help with other tasks
3. *System* - scripts to help with system administration like reading and setting env files, getting installed software, etc.
4. *RSS* - scripts to help with RSS feeds - read rss feeds, get latest news, etc.

To run the scripts you will need to have PowerShell installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell). I recommmend using [Windows Terminal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/install) and [PowerToys](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/powertoys/).
